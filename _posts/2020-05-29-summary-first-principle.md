# What is it?**

Break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. Removing impurity of assumptions and conventional wisdoms to see what is truly possible.

# How do you apply it? 

Be a children. Children instinctively think in first principles. Knowing the difference between knowing the name of something, and knowing something. Always ask why and don’t inherit assumptions.

# What's the benefit?

Cut through the fog of shoddy reasoning and inadequate analogies to see opportunities that others miss. You can decide if the existing methods make sense. Often they don’t.

# The danger of not knowing it?

If we never learn to take something apart, test the assumptions, and reconstruct it, we end up trapped in what other people tell us — trapped in the way things have always been done. When the environment changes, we just continue as if things were the same.
The real power of first-principles thinking is moving away from incremental improvement and into possibility. Letting others think for us means that we’re using their analogies, their conventions, and their possibilities. It means we’ve inherited a world that conforms to what they think. This is incremental thinking.

# Any behaviour to avoid?

"Because I said so".
We hate this game [of constantly asking why why why] because after one or two questions, we are often lost. Confronted with our own ignorance, we resort to self-defense. We actually don’t know why.

"Analogy thinking"
Analogies can’t replace understanding. While it’s easier on your brain to reason by analogy, you’re more likely to come up with better answers when you reason by first principles. This is what makes it one of the best sources of creative thinking. Thinking in first principles allows you to adapt to a changing environment, deal with reality, and seize opportunities that others can’t see.

# Is there any example?

Chef vs Cook. Chef understands flavor profile and basic characteristic of an ingredient. Cook only knows how to follow recipes. Chef is the first principle thinker.

# Practical application in daily life?

Reasoning by first principles is useful when you are: 
(1) doing something for the first time, (2) dealing with complexity, and (3) trying to understand a situation that you’re having problems with.

# Conclusion?

Don’t make assumption. Question everything.
