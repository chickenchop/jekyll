Four must have components on your video ads: 
	1. **Hook** – opener/attention grabber.
	2. **Agitate** – ask a question/show transformation/identify problem.
	3. **Solution** – what you are offering.
	4. **Call to Action** – what you want your audience to do.

### Hook (First 3 seconds)
Should be short and simple. This is where most audiences are lost. So grab their attention -- and keep it.

Here's a do and don't:
	- Do: Open up with a story (You can use the phrase: "When I was...") or ask a controversial question or something else. E.g.
	"I have bad news...". Anything that **grabs their attention to stop them from scrolling.**
	- Don't: introduce who you are or start the video with a logo. **This isn't about you, this is about your audience.**

Example:
SATU CELANA SEMUA AKTIVITAS
CELANA DENGAN 1,000 TESTIMONIAL BINTANG 5
TIRED WITH YOUR JEANS?

### Agitation (Next 3-10 seconds)
This is where you start to build up their emotions (fears, desires, etc.)
	1. Transition to the problem. **What is your audience's problem?**
	2. **State the problem clearly and concisely.**
	Use market language. What have they been asking on forums? 
	3. Agitate them - not in a bad way - so that you can ignite a response. Here are some things you can talk about:
		- Pain
		- Pleasure
		- Excitement 
	4. **Naturally lead them to look for a solution.**
	This will help you transition to the next step, which is to describe the solution.

Example:
MASIH PAKE BAJU KEDODORAN?
HP GOYANG PAS LARI?

### Solution (Next 10-25s)
The goal here is to **paint a picture of the solution (your offer) and how it can help your audience** can make their goals and dreams a reality. 
- Tell your audience what the solution is.
- Explain how/why it works. 
- Describe how it will change their lives.
 
Example:
FITUR PRODUK - slim fit, stretch, kantong zipper, menyerap keringat. 

### CTA (Last few seconds of the video)
Use these questions as a guide to craft the perfect CTA:
- What action do you want your audience to take?
- Should you use a soft CTA or a hard CTA?
- What should they expect after clicking on your ad?
 
Example:
SHOP NOW
BELI SEBELUM KEHABISAN
