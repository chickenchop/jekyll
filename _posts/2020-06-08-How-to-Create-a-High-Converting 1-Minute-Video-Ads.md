Four must have components on your video ads:

**Hook** – opener/attention grabber.<br>
**Agitate** – ask a question/show transformation/identify problem.<br>
**Solution** – what you are offering.<br>
**Call to Action** – what you want your audience to do.<br>

### Hook (First 3 seconds)
Should be short and simple. This is where most audiences are lost. So grab their attention -- and keep it. Here's a do and don't:

- Do: Open up with a story or ask a controversial question or something else. E.g. "I have bad news...". Anything that grabs their attention to stop them from scrolling.
- Don't: introduce who you are or start the video with a logo. This isn't about you, this is about your audience.

Example:<br>
SATU CELANA SEMUA AKTIVITAS.<br>
CELANA DENGAN 1,000 TESTIMONIAL BINTANG 5.<br>

### Agitation (Next 3-10 seconds)
This is where you start to build up their emotions (fears, desires, etc.):
- Transition to the problem. What is your audience's problem? State the problem clearly and concisely.
- Use market language. What have they been asking on forums?
- Agitate them - not in a bad way - so that you can ignite a response. Here are some things you can talk about:
		- Pain
		- Pleasure
		- Excitement 
- Naturally lead them to look for a solution. This will help you transition to the next step, which is to describe the solution.

Example:<br>
HP GOYANG PAS LARI? NGGA LAGI KALAU PAKE INI..

### Solution (Next 10-25s)
The goal here is to paint a picture of the solution (your offer) and how it can help your audience can make their goals and dreams a reality. 
- Tell your audience what the solution is.
- Explain how/why it works. 
- Describe how it will change their lives.
 
Example:<br>
FITUR PRODUK - slim fit, secure pockets. 

### CTA (Last few seconds of the video)
Use these questions as a guide to craft the perfect CTA:
- What action do you want your audience to take?
- Should you use a soft CTA or a hard CTA?
- What should they expect after clicking on your ad?
 
Example:<br>
SHOP NOW<br>
BELI SEBELUM KEHABISAN<br>
