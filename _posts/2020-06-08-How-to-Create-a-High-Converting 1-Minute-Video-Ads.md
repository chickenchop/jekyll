Four must have components on your video ads:

**Hook** – opener/attention grabber.

**Agitate** – ask a question/show transformation/identify problem.

**Solution** – what you are offering.

**Call to Action** – what you want your audience to do.

### Hook (First 3 seconds)
Should be short and simple. This is where most audiences are lost. So grab their attention -- and keep it.

Here's a do and don't:

Do: Open up with a story (You can use the phrase: "When I was...") or ask a controversial question or something else. E.g. "I have bad news...". Anything that **grabs their attention to stop them from scrolling.**

Don't: introduce who you are or start the video with a logo. **This isn't about you, this is about your audience.**

Example:

SATU CELANA SEMUA AKTIVITAS

CELANA DENGAN 1,000 TESTIMONIAL BINTANG 5

TIRED WITH YOUR JEANS?

### Agitation (Next 3-10 seconds)
This is where you start to build up their emotions (fears, desires, etc.):
- Transition to the problem. What is your audience's problem? State the problem clearly and concisely.
- Use market language. What have they been asking on forums?
- Agitate them - not in a bad way - so that you can ignite a response. Here are some things you can talk about:
		- Pain
		- Pleasure
		- Excitement 
- Naturally lead them to look for a solution. This will help you transition to the next step, which is to describe the solution.

Example:

MASIH PAKE BAJU KEDODORAN?

HP GOYANG PAS LARI?

### Solution (Next 10-25s)
The goal here is to paint a picture of the solution (your offer) and how it can help your audience can make their goals and dreams a reality. 
- Tell your audience what the solution is.
- Explain how/why it works. 
- Describe how it will change their lives.
 
Example:
FITUR PRODUK - slim fit, stretch, kantong zipper, menyerap keringat. 

### CTA (Last few seconds of the video)
Use these questions as a guide to craft the perfect CTA:
- What action do you want your audience to take?
- Should you use a soft CTA or a hard CTA?
- What should they expect after clicking on your ad?
 
Example:
SHOP NOW
BELI SEBELUM KEHABISAN
